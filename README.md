# TableExtract

TableExtract is a Rust library for parsing HTML tables. It is inspired by Perl's HTML::TableExtract.

## Usage

TableExtract is on [crates.io][1]. Just add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
table-extract = "0.1.0"
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! There are two things to keep in mind:

1. This project uses the nightly Rust toolchain from [rustup][2].
2. This project uses `cargo fmt` to keep the code tidy.
